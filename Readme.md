## Description
This project performs operations on BMP images, including rotations and applying a Gaussian blur filter. The program loads a BMP image, rotates it by 90 and 270 degrees, and then applies Gaussian filtering. After each operation, the result is saved in a new file. The user can customize the filter parameters, such as kernel size and sigma value for the Gaussian blur. The program works only with 24-bit BMP images. The input file must be named "input.bmp"!
